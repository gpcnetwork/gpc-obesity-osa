# Study Overview

Obesity is a multifactorial condition with significant public health burden, affecting 40% of adults in the US and accounting for millions of cardiovascular (CV) disease deaths every year. Despite extensive evidence linking diet and physical activity with obesity risk, there is greater attention about the importance of adequate sleep habits towards mitigating obesity and its related cardiometabolic risk. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-disordered breathing condition contributing to these associations, with estimated population rates of 9%-37% in men and 4-50% in women, affecting 1 billion people worldwide. OSA becomes more prevalent with age and obesity, and is associated with coronary heart disease, stroke, and CV mortality. Thus, there is increasing attention on therapies that may modify CV risk factors for through targeting sleep disordered breathing in the context of obesity. In this context, the current investigation will leverage real-world clinical and claims data from older adults with OSA that are part of the Greater Plain Collaborative (GPC) to estimate the effect of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on cardiovascular risk across health systems in underserved regions of the US. We will 1) address this primary research question by leveraging available Medicare Claims data; and 2) understand barriers in integrating additional information from clinical sleep center towards enrichment of granular sleep disordered breathing and PAP utilization data, currently limiting the full characterization of OSA heterogeneity in datasets at this scale.
